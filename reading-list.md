Some of my favourite books that I would recommend reading (or listening!). I listen to books in Audible, helping me to effectively use the time when I am driving or walking. Another excellent book platform I have discovered is [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/), a book publishing platform with an agile approach to writing books.
