_Continuous Learning_ is key to stay relevant in today's fast changing IT landscape. As a Solution Architect or a Technologist it is extremely important to have reasonable understanding of emerging technologies and have a very fast learning curve.

Here are some resources I have used and liked. All the resources are freely available and I have found them immensely useful for (1) Build a good understanding of the technology (2) Learn them fast.

This is a living document and I keep updating them as and when I find something really useful.

Hope you find these useful.
