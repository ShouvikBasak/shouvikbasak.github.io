Agent‑first development is where humans define intent and constraints; and Agents execute using artifacts, not prompts, to carry context and control.

Vibe coding optimizes for speed.
Agent‑first development optimizes for control.

While working on a PromptWars hackathon build using **Google Antigravity**, I noticed a difference that quietly changed how I approached building a prototype.

The prototype isn’t complete. I hit model quota limits. Some parts are still stubs. And yet, the most valuable outcome wasn’t the demo.

### What changed
Vibe coding keeps state in my head. When the session ends, context leaks.

Antigravity pushed me to externalize thinking:
- Task plans instead of mental checklists (and scattered paper notes). 
- Some examples being, creating Artifacts like tightly controlled _ARCHITECTURE.md_ with well defined frontend, backend, data and AI layers; 
- _DATAMODEL.md_ with strict boundaries for the agent to follow while creating the database schema.
- Explicit contracts instead of implied intent, like the _AICONTRACT.md_ defining the strict operational contract for the Gemini AI reasoning module to adhere to. Critical for predictable behaviours, limiting the agent to the constraints.
- Implementation plans instead of tribal knowledge. Antigravity creates plans and there is full control to review and refine, much before the actual coding begins. All to harness the power of AI, yet keeping it in control.

Human‑in‑the‑loop gives a last‑mile control surface when reality diverges from the model.

The workflow naturally settled into something more deliberate:  

> Ideation => Scope => Rules & Constraints => Artifacts => Build Code => Deploy => Test => Iterate

Nothing exotic. Just explicit. Maybe boring.

This gave me far more control over how agents behave and what they produce, not just through prompts, but through artifacts.

### Artifacts - Why this matters
The moment planning, execution, and verification become artifacts, the work:
- crystallizes the idea.
- becomes reviewable.
- scales beyond exploration.

That’s when agentic development stopped feeling like _faster coding_ and started feeling like _architectural leverage_.

### A working hypothesis
If agentic systems are going to matter beyond experimentation, they won’t look like better copilots. They’ll look like systems that remember, validate, and explain.

This post is the first in a series, where I will share my experience with agentic development. These are things I am discovering as I build things and wish I had clarity on before starting.

Some topics to follow:
- Why walkthroughs are better than READMEs for AI‑generated systems
- What quotas and limits taught me about designing AI‑assisted systems
- Human‑in‑the‑loop isn’t a compromise, it’s an architectural control.
