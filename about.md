I am based in Delhi, India and work at a leading Fortune 500 global IT services organization as a Solution Architect, helping clients on their Cloud and Digital Transformation journey. You can find more on what I do at work in my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shouvikbasak/) profile.

My technology interests are varied and always evolving, with my current interest being more on Cloud, DevOps and automation. Long back when I decided to choose IT as my career, I basically managed to convert my hobby into my profession. I am intrigued by insights derived from data and the opportunities it brings to predict, decide and act. To fulfil my keen interest in this field of study, I am currently pursuing my postgrad in Data Science.

I also love telling stories through the visual medium and do editorial and documentary photography projects. You can find more about my photography projects, published work and workshops in my photography website at [shouvikbasak.com](https://www.shouvikbasak.com/).
