I am based in Delhi, India and work at [DXC Technology](https://dxc.technology) as a Solution Architect, helping clients on their Cloud and Digital Transformation journey. You can find more on what I do at work in my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shouvikbasak/) profile.

My technology interests are varied and always evolving, with my current interest being more on Cloud, DevOps and automation. Long back when I decided to choose IT as my career, I basically managed to convert my hobby into my profession.

Last few years I am intrigued by _data_ and the opportunities that it brings in the field of Artificial Intelligence and predictions using Machine Learning. With an interest in research and academics, I am currently pursuing M.Tech in Data Science and Engineering from BITS Pilani.

I also love telling stories through the visual medium and do editorial and documentary photography projects. You can find more about my photography projects, published work and workshops in my photography website at [shouvikbasak.com](https://www.shouvikbasak.com/).
