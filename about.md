I am based in Delhi, India and work at DXC Technology as a Public Cloud Solution Architect, helping clients on their Cloud and Digital Transformation journey. You can find more on what I do at work in my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shouvikbasak/) profile. 

My technology interests are varied and always evolving, with my current interest being more on Cloud, DevOps and automation. I am passionate about solving business problems with technology. Long back when I decided to choose IT as my career, I basically managed to convert my hobby into my profession.

I also love telling stories through the visual medium and do editorial and documentary photography projects. You can find more about my photography projects, published work and workshops in my [photography website](https://www.shouvikbasak.com/).
